* Execution starts at the first address (0). 
* Execution stops when program reaches last address (15).
* Whatever gets written to the last address is sent to the printer.
* Computer has one 8 bit register.
* When reading from the last address (15), we get a random byte value.

Instruction set
---------------

* `READ       ----` - Copies the value at the specified address into register.  
* `WRITE      ---*` - Copies value of the register to the specified address.  
* `ADD        --*-` - Adds value at the specified address to the value of the register, and writes result to the register. If result is bigger than the maximum possible value (255 = ********) then 255 gets written.  
* `SUB        --**` - Subtracts value at the speicfied address from the value of the register, and writes result to the register. If result is smaller than 0 then 0 gets written.  
* `JUMP IMD   -*--`  - Changes the value of the program counter to the specified address, meaning that in the next cycle execution will continue at that address.  
* `IF MAX     -*-*` - Jumps to the specified address if register has value 255 = `********`. 
* `IF MIN     -**-` - Jumps to the specified address if register has value 0 = `--------`. 
* `SHIFT L/R  -***` - Moves bits in the register in the direction specified by the value. If first bit of the value is '-', then it moves them to the left, otherwise to the right. Remaining three bits specify the number of spots, that they get moved.
* `READ IN    *---` - Copies the value at the last address (random or stdin) to the specified address.
* `WRITE OUT  *--*` - Copies the value at the specified address to the last address (printer or stdout).
* `ADD IMD    *-*-` - Adds specified value to the value of the register, and writes result to the register. If result is bigger than the maximum possible value (255 = ********) then 255 gets written. 
* `SUB IMD    *-**` - Subtracts specified value from the value of the register, and writes result to the register. If result is smaller than 0 then 0 gets written.
* `JUMP       **  ` -
* `IF NOT MAX **-*` - Jumps to the specified address if register does not have value 255 = `********`. 
* `IF NOT MIN ***-` - Jumps to the specified address if register does not have value 0 = `--------`. 
* `AND/OR     ****` - If first bit of the value is '-', then AND gets executed, otherwise OR. Other three bits specify the address. Operation is executed between the value of register and value at the specified address, and result is written to register. Since only three bits are used for the address, this instruction can only be used with first eight addresses of the data ram.

How to run onâ€¦
--------------

### Windows

* Install *Tiny Core Linux* on *VirtualBox* using this [**instructions**](https://github.com/gto76/my-linux-setup/tree/gh-pages/conf-files/tiny-core-linux).
* Run the *UNIX* commands.

### UNIX
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gto76/comp-m2.git
cd comp-m2
./run
```

Non-interactive mode
------------------
If `comp` binary is executed with a pipe input, then it runs in non-iteractive mode, meaning there is no graphical interface. Also, instead of a random number when reading from last address we get a value from stdin and instead to a printer, output is sent to stdout. Input can either consist of strings of "*" and "-", or integers.  

Example of multiplication:
```
$ echo "3 4" | ./comp examples/mulToSum | ./comp examples/sumAll
-----**-   6
----*--*   9
----**--  12
```
